## GraphQL
- GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. 
- Gives you exactly what you ask for.
- `Schema` - tells GraphQL what our data looks like.
- `Root Query` - allows us to jump into our graph of data(kinda like an entrypoint), it's required in graphQL
- `resolve` - actually goes into the DB and executes the query or command.
